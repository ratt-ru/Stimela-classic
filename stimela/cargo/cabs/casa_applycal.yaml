# same here, using _use to include common behaviours, but we also add an extra one for the cleanup section
management:
  _use: base.casa.management.common

  cleanup:         
    applycal.last: [DELETE]
  
  # an interesting point here is that _use implements a "deep merge". I.e. the contents of 'cleanup' here do not
  # replace 'casa.management.common.cleanup', but are rather added to it. This is probably what we want for most 
  # cases. If needed, we can code up a _use_shallow which implements the replace behaviour.
